some light-weight version of my dotfiles

the idea is this is all hopefully light-weight enough to easily maintain in
parallel to my real dotfiles. the main purpose is to be able to use outside of
my own computers, eg: a shared OSX machine at a university. Since OSX has a shit
version of bash, some "bash3" comments are made explaining workarounds that are
encoded.
